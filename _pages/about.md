<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I did my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, and Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Computer Vision, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

During my PhD, I applied materials science and engineering principles to understand and design resistive memory devices on electrochemical processes. My research passion lies in developing information processing paradigms using emerging materials and devices, including solid-state ionic, two-dimensional materials, spintronic, ferroelectric, and superconducting systems. 

In addition to my research, I have also worked on projects in computer vision, including building object recognition and scene understanding pipelines. Recently, I am focusing on a hobby project of a 3D-printed robotic arm integrated with large language models for control and learning.

[Electrochemical random-access memory: progress, perspectives, and opportunities](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.4c00512)

A Alec Talin\*, Jordan Meyer, **Jingxian Li**, Mantao Huang, Miranda Schwacke, Heejung W Chung, Longlong Xu, Elliot J Fuller, Yiyang Li\*, Bilge Yildiz*

*Chemical Reviews* **125(4)**, 1962-2008 (2025) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Snh-2QIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC'></span></strong>
- In this review, we discuss the history, basic concepts, recent progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities for different types of electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM), broadly grouped by their primary mobile ionic charge carrier, including **lithium ions**, **protons**, and **oxygen ions**.

[Nonvolatile electrochemical memory at 600¬∞C enabled by composition phase separation](https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00580-5)

*Device* **3(3)**, 100623 (2025) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Snh-2QIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC'></span></strong>
- We present a solid-state memory device that can operate and store information at temperatures as high as 600¬∞C. Rather than relying on the motion of electrons, this device stores information through the electrochemical migration of **oxygen ions**, in which the high-temperature information retention is a result of **composition phase separation**.

- Previously, information retention was believed to arise from the slow diffusion of **oxygen ions** in the resistive switching material that kinetically ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the information state. In this study, we show that information retention is not only a result of slow oxygen diffusion but also a thermodynamic property of **composition phase separation**.

*Materials Horizons* **7**, 71-81 (2020) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Snh-2QIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C'></span></strong>
- In a neuromorphic computer, information processing and memory are governed by the neurons and the synapses. Our study employs the electrochemical migration and thermodynamic relaxation of **silver ions** to accurately mimic the dynamic processes of synapses and neurons in biological systems.

**Jingxian Li**, Zhiran Wang, Naichen Shi

- We explore the challenge of generating 3D models from single or sparse-view 2D images that use advanced neural architectures and techniques like 3D Gaussian splatting for detailed model generation. We provide a series of evaluations that demonstrate significant advances in generative models that bridge the gap between 2D inputs and 3D outputs.
