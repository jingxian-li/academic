<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I did my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, and Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Computer Vision, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I received my Master's degree in Materials Science and Engineering in 2018 and my Bachelor's degree in Materials Physics in 2015, both from the University of Science and Technology Beijing.

During my PhD, I applied materials science and engineering principles to understand and design resistive memory devices on electrochemical processes. Specifically, I investigated oxygen transport dynamics in two-terminal resistive random-access memory (RRAM) and developed high-temperature three-terminal electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM). 

My research passion lies in developing information processing paradigms using emerging materials and devices, including spintronic, ferroelectric, superconducting, and electrochemical systems. I have published ~10 papers <!--(<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snh-2QIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>)--> at leading journals, such as Chemical Reviews, Matter, Materials Horizons, and Device.

[Nonvolatile electrochemical memory at 600¬∞C enabled by composition phase separation](https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00580-5)

**Jingxian Li\***, Andrew J Jalbert, Sangyong Lee, Leah S Simakas, Noah J Geisler, Virgil J Watkins, Laszlo A Cline, Elliot J Fuller, A Alec Talin, Yiyang Li*

*Device* **3(3)**, 100623 (2025) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='Snh-2QIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC'></span></strong>
- We present a solid-state memory device that can operate and store information at temperatures as high as 600 ¬∞C. Rather than relying on the motion of electrons, this device stores information through the electrochemical migration of oxygen ions in transition metal oxides, a process that resembles that of solid oxide fuel cells and batteries.
